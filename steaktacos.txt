The cuisine of Oaxaca, a state in Southern Mexico, is famous for its moles—or sauces. There are seven unique moles, each with its own flavor profile. Mole verde is the lightest of the seven. It gets its green tint from tomatillos (relatives of the tomato), toasted pumpkin seeds, fresh herbs and lime juice. We’re using this delicious sauce to bring a touch of brightness to our classic steak tacos, served with creamy avocado and peppery radish.
